### Quick summary

The development of this product begins with the lifting requirements. To have control of them and give them a scope is a decisive factor in the project’s success. These requirements were built in association with scientists, producers of areas, professional technicians who provide the assistance to the farmers and guilds.  In this system it took account each user’s needs, having into account the feasibility of each one of the requirements in the duration of the project. It was assessed the usability of the user in two important points of the project that allowed to see that the system helps in great extend in the assimilation of the information.

The system development had different versions in form of spring that allowed seeing the stakeholders, the advance of the project. Through continual feedback about the advance of the project and the development of the platform, it was consolidated concepts that at the beginning they were not very clear.  The cooperation among class entities and CIAT allowed creating a system that can be adapted by each guild in order to support their decisions making.

All of the above helped in the architecture design that can be scalable and sustainable over time.
