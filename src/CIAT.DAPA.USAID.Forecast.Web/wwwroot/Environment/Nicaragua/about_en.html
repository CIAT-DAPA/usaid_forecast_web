        About the project
    </h3>
    <p>
        This web application is being developed by the Bioversity International Alliance and the CIAT International Center for Tropical Agriculture, as part of a joint effort with national institutions, local producer organizations and international organizations. This is to have a meeting point regarding agroclimatic information for specific sites or at an appropriate scale. The methods and models used to generate the forecasts presented here are under development, testing and validation. However, they perform well.

        Scenario generation
    </h3>
    <p>
        Seasonal climate predictions give us probabilistic information of the categories - below normal, normal and above normal - over the next 6 months. Based on this information, different scenarios can be obtained on a daily basis, which serve as a guide. input to enter the cultivation models.

        The process of transitioning from probabilities to daily climate data can be carried out through a resampling method, which consists of obtaining the tertiles of the historical data and resampling each tertile based on the probabilities of the predictions. For example: for a given precipitation prediction of 70% below normal, 20% normal and 10% above normal, for a month of interest, then resampling will choose 70 daily data scenarios for the below normal tertile, 20 daily data scenarios from the normal tertile and 10 daily data scenarios from the tertile above normal, assuming that the total number of scenarios to be generated will be 100.
