    <p>
        Aclimate Angola is an agroclimatic platform developed in the context of a consultative project aimed at creating a support platform for decision-making in the agricultural financial sector in Angola. This effort is an integral part of the Commercial Agriculture Development Project (PDAC), with the objective of increasing productivity and facilitating access to the market for selected beneficiaries in the provinces of Malanje, Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul, Huambo, Bié and Fuja.

        This agroclimatic platform provides specific information for corn, feijão, soybean and coffee production areas in the mentioned provinces. It is composed of three fundamental modules:

        <li>
            <strong>Agroclimatic Map Viewer:</strong> This module enables users, mostly extensionists, technical teams and decision-making bodies, to view spatial historical data related to agroclimatic indicators. These indicators cover the water needs of the plantations, dry periods, rainy periods, heat waves, water deficits and excess water. Through this module, users have the opportunity to explore how different phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, such as "El Niño" and "La Niña", will historically impact water demands in corn, wheat, soybean-producing regions and coffee. Furthermore, it is possible to identify agricultural areas more prone to drought, floods and heat waves.

            <strong>Seasonal Weather Forecasts:</strong> This module provides information on seasonal weather forecasts, both probabilistic and deterministic, for precipitation, temperatures and solar radiation at municipal level. These projections are updated monthly, with a horizon of up to six months and grouped in quarters. Furthermore, users have access to historical data (in the form of graphs and tables) of the aforementioned climatic variables, referring to the localities of interest.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Productivity forecast:</strong> This module allows access to information on the productivity forecast of corn, feijão and soybean crops, considering the climatic conditions projected for the next six months. Here, users can generate projections for the performance of the mentioned cultures, taking into account different planting times, types of soil and specific varieties of the study region. The information made available by this module allows users to identify the best planting data to optimize the yield of cultures.
